Albert Einstein once said, "imagination is more important than knowledge." Human beings are the only creatures we know of that are capable of doing imaginative work. Let's give them more time to do just that.

Keeping records is important. For example, your medical history could help your doctor prescribe a medication for you. When you go buy a home, your credit history factors into the APR you get on the mortgage. Your job resume often weighs heavily in a company deciding whether or not you're qualified for a certain role. 

However, human potential can never truly be objectified; deciding what a document should mean for your future does not help you to create that future to the best of your ability. People who create the best version of themselves look forward when deciding which direction they want to move their life in. Records and data are merely a convenience we carry for society, which for some reason usually makes a decision on us based on our past.

Let's use software to automate the process of deciding what data should mean for our lives. Let's maximize the time we spend worrying about what we - our future decisions, our ability to create a better tomorrow - mean for our lives.

This project is a proof of concept of such a system. It represents a customer service kiosk at a car wash. Users input certain information about their needs, in this case their order for an automobile service. The system stores the information and outputs transaction information to help the user make a decision. For example, it will prompt you for the type of vehicle you want service for, the service plan you'd like, and based on that output the cost, as well as the time it will take the shop to service your vehicle.

This project is a continuation of my other project, DocumentRecommendations. It is in a different repository because this project is structured differently than the other, and with my knowledge of Git I regretfully cannot find a faster alternative to this solution.

Hope you will contribute!
